How to start the project:
- On .NET press play -> it will instance 1 PuppetMasterObject and 1 PCSProgram (if you want to run in different machines change the default configuration on .net);
- Instance 2 more PCSProgram's;
- For each PCSProgram terminal put the port 11000, 11001, 11002 (to test in the same machine we need different ports) and press enter in each of them;
- Put the first command from Configuration.txt and press enter;
- Put the second and it'll show up a client window and press create game with the port that shows up;
- Put the third command and it'll show up another client window; where it says "port" put the port 8081 and press connect to game;
- the game will start now

Missing Features:
- Some of the parameters of the commands to start both clients and servers are not used;
- Not all commands were done for PuppetMaster;
- Lot of details missing due to the fact that they're many to consider and takes a lot of work;
